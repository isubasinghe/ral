#RAL Register Access Language 

BitFields are a common pattern in systems programming but they present a challenge when programming. 
Especially when writing assembly code, it is way too easy to make trivial errors because of simple mistakes. 

RAL generates code to make bitfield acces easier. 

The project is being developed to save on development time on [jardinii](https://github.com/isubasinghe/jardinii). Trivial errors thanks to 
invalid bitfield access in assembly lead to significant time waste, RAL aims to solve this issue and only this issue.
